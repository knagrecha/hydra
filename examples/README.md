# Hydra HPO
## Prerequisites and Setup

- Your machine must have at least one GPU.
- We assume PyTorch version 1.8.1.

## Summary
In this example, we'll run hyperparameter optimization on a batches of models.

To run the fine-tuning script for 3 models, launch ``python3 three-task-lm.py``. 
We also have a 12 model script which you can run with ``python3 twelve-task-lm.py``.
